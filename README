1. Compile using make
2. The port number is specified in the program.
3. Execute command: ./server
   	   	    ./client pyrite <command> or ./client pyrite-n2 <command>

4. I failed to send the stdout and stderror back to the client. Some constructive feedbacks from the TAs will be greatly appreciated.
